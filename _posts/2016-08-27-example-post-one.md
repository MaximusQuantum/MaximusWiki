Bones is a skeletal wizard thatâ€™s trying to become more powerful. This is his mission since a wizard cursed him to not die until he becomes the greatest wizard of all time. This is especially concerning for Bones, because he is very lazy and always tired.

He travels with his companion turtle Methusula.
